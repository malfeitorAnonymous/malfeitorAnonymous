🕵️‍♂️ I am a cybersecurity enthusiast and ethical hacker. I dedicate myself to discovering vulnerabilities, strengthening systems, and sharing knowledge to build a safer cyberspace.

🐍 I've specialized in Python to create penetration tools, forensic analysis, and automate security-related tasks.

🔒 Currently working on: developing a new vulnerability analysis tool for web systems.

📘 I'm learning: advanced evasion techniques and reverse engineering.

🤖 Notable projects: CyberToolX and SecurePy.

📫 How to reach me: I prefer anonymity, but you can open an issue on one of my repositories if you'd like to collaborate.

⚡ Fun fact: I've participated in several CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions and am always looking for the next challenge!
